### Description of the web application
We aim to develop an application that a marketplace provide a space for restaurants to post their menu,<br/>
and customers can view delicate **3D food models** and also send orders to restaurants, for self pickup at<br/>
a scheduled time frame.<br/>
- When customer sign up, a confirmation email/SMS message would generate and be sent to the customer<br/>
- When creating an order, customer could choose dishes from one certain restaurant and choose a pickup<br/>
time frame at their convenience.<br/>
- Our platform provides payment options for customers to pay online directly.<br/>
- On ordering, customer would receive an SMS message that includes order information and pickup time frame.<br/>
- Restaurants can upload 3D models of their dished for a realistic and appealing look when creating menus.<br/>
- An customer service is available online for ordering assistance and payment issue.<br/>

### What complexity points will this project contain 
- PeerJS - Simple peer-to-peer with WebRTC
- Communication APIs for SMS, Voice, Video & Authentication | Twilio
- Stripe | Payment Processing Platform for the Internet
- Three.js â€“ JavaScript 3D Library

### (optional) What complexity points will be attempted as bonus for the challenge factor
- Email Delivery, API, Marketing Service | SendGrid
- OpenAI API; to make our customer service automated


### What you aim to complete for the alpha version, beta version, and final version
