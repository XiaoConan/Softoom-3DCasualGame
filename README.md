### Description of the web application

Softoom is a casual game that brings the player's own thoughts, personality and behavior into a virtual world.<br/>
It is an independent(no interact) game in which it doesn't require players to invest a lot of times and effort on it, but can make playes relax mentally. Enjoy<br/>
the feeling of living in a cozy and comfortable room. <br/>

- This application creates a 3D room for every user and every user has his/her own 3D character model. Players <br/>
  are able to move in their room. <br/>
- When a user sign up, a 3D room with all furniture created, style base on the gender that user selected<br/>
- The 3D room contains a food menu and a fridge, where they can order food and store it in the fridge.<br/>
- Each user has a hunger value, and it decreases as time passes. If the hunger value decreases to 0,<br/>
  the user will be hungry and you will need to feed them, but it is not forced<br/>
- The user can gain hunger value by ordering food. Buying food requires payment.<br/>
- On delivery, food can be consumed right away, or be stored in the fridge.<br/>
