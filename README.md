### Description of the web application
- This application creates a 3D room for every user. User has his/her own 3D identity in the room.<br/>
- When a user sign up, a confirmation email/SMS message would generate and be sent to the user.<br/>
- The 3D room contains a food menu and a fridge, where they can make food and store it in the fridge.<br/>
- Each user has a hunger value, and it decrease as time passes. If the hunger value decreases to 0,<br/>
the user dies and then reborn, with a new room and new fridge.<br/>
- The user can gain hunger value by ordering or making food. Buying materials or food requires payment.<br/>
On delivery, food can be consumed right away, or be stored in the fridge.<br/>
- The user has a friend list, and they are able to visit their friend's room and steal it.<br/>
- Players are able to speak to one another when in the same room.<br/>
